# Column-Transformer
A "column transformer" is a concept often used in data preprocessing for machine learning. It's a tool or technique that allows you to apply different preprocessing steps to different columns or subsets of columns in a dataset.

The main idea is to define a set of operations, such as data scaling, one-hot encoding, or feature extraction, and then apply these operations to specific columns in your dataset, based on rules or criteria you specify. This is particularly useful when you have a dataset with a mix of numerical and categorical features that require different preprocessing steps.

Column transformers help streamline the data preprocessing process, making it more organized and efficient, and are commonly used in libraries like scikit-learn in Python to prepare data for machine learning models. They enable you to apply the appropriate transformations to each feature, ensuring that your data is in the right format for modeling.
